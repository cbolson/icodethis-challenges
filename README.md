# iCodeThis callenges

Since May 2023 I have been taking part in the daily icodethis front-end challengs.
Unlike other similar platforms, these challenges are open to interpretation and you are encouraged to explore the possibilities both in terms of the design and in adding functionality via JavaScript. It is not a competion and there are no prizes, just the satisfaction of doing the challenge to the best of your ability.

It is also backed up by a great Discord community where there is always somebody around to help or make suggestions, and also to push you to improve. Thanks to this platform I have finally learnt Tailwind!.
