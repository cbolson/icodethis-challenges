          <h2>Preamble</h2>
          <p>
            We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect
            Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for
            the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the
            Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and
            establish this Constitution for the United States of America.
          </p>

          <h2>Article I</h2>
          <p>
            All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress
            of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of
            Representatives.
          </p>

          <h2>Article II</h2>
          <p>
            The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United
            States. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and
            together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be
            elected, as follows:
          </p>

          <h2>Article III</h2>
          <p>
            The judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one
            supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from
            time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme
            and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour,
            and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a
            Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance
            in Office.
          </p>

          <h2>Article IV</h2>
          <p>
            Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public
            Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And
            the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such
            Acts, Records, and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect
            thereof.
          </p>

          <h2>Article V</h2>
          <p>
            The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it
            necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the
            Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States,
            shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either
            Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this
            Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of
            the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as
            the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the
            Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the
            Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect
            the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first
            Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived
            of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.
          </p>

            made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be
            made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme
            Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound
            thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the
            Contrary notwithstanding.
          </p>

          <h2>Article VII</h2>
          <p>
            The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be
            sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the
            States so ratifying the Same.
